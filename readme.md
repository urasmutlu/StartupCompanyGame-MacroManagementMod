# Macro-Management Mod for Startup Company Game

Macro-management of the features and components. (Works on Beta 17.5, if it works on other Betas too, let me know, I'll add here).

To use the mode, you should have managers and at least one designer, developer, or lead developer working under these managers. You can choose to upgrade any feature of your product by clicking the plus button. Then every employee working under your managers will start to create components to improve that feature.

Or you can choose to create or not create individual components from the "components" tab.

If you have any improvement suggestions or if you have problems, please write to the discussion board of the mod.

Have fun!
